# Spotify Clone 
Simple enough. A clone of spotify. You can search for songs, play them, and interact with favorites etc. This is just a way to get familiar with the Spotify API, I'm not particularly thinking I'm creating an impressive or interesting app here. This is preliminary, the actual impressive and interesting app would be TuneMatch, and this is just practice for that. TuneMatch is the boss battle, and this is training.

Today I initialized a react application with vite, registered it with the Spotify API, and got Authentication working. There is a change I finish this all in one day. I will keep updating.
