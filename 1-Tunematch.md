<h1 style = "text-align: center;">Tunematch : Ai Powered Song Suggestions</h1>


<h2> [5-15-2024] </h2><br>

I'm an avid music listener. Without music, life just wouldn't be the same. A problem I have is that in every music app I use, the automatically generated song suggestions disappoint me. These algorithms are a black box to everyone who doesn't work there, but I have a hunch that they suggest you things based on the genre of a song, the artist, or whatever. 

For example, I can play a rap song I like, and be guaranteed that another rap song will follow - but I'm not guaranteed it'll be a song that *sounds like* the one I previously listened to. I think these algorithms prioritize convenience and a constant stream of content, instead of doing what it should be doing and *making every suggestion a banger* (and subsequently foregoing that "wide net genre stream" approach that is hit or miss). 

For me, another issue is that some songs I like, but that doesn't mean I like the entire artist's discography, because artists evolve and so do their target demographics. I am often disappointed by this, and it makes me feel like I found a hidden 1 of 1 gem with a vibe that I will not find elsewhere unless I comb through hundreds of songs that *just dont fit the bill*. 

To make a long story short, I need something more precise. 

So I am making <strong>Tunematch<strong>. Tunematch is a webapp that leverages AI to specifically reccomend songs that *sound like* the song you like, and let you listen to them with spotify from there. No weird hit or miss curation algos, just stuff you're guaranteed to like. Think of it like a guy that can put you on to the best music by just giving him a song name for reference. 

Today, I initialized the project and got started importing all of my dependencies. More to come tomorrow.
