# Tunematch : Ai Powered Song Suggestions 

## 5-15-24
I'm an avid music listener. Without music, life just wouldn't be the same. A problem I have is that in every music app I use, the automatically generated song suggestions disappoint me. These algorithms are a black box to everyone who doesn't work there, but I have a hunch that they suggest you things based on the genre of a song, the artist, or whatever. 

Tunematch is a webapp that leverages AI to specifically reccomend songs that *sound like* the song you like, and let you listen to them with spotify from there. No weird hit or miss curation algos, just stuff you're guaranteed to like. Think of it like a guy that can put you on to the best music by just giving him a song name for reference. 

Today, I got started planning the UI, interactivity, and which APIs I would need. More to come tomorrow.

I decided I wanted to go with creating a React App, because I feel like it was suited to what I decided to make, which would effectively be a Single Page Application. I started on the UI, I haven't added any functionality at all yet. I am just working on componentizing everything in a way that is intelligent and easy to maintain. This will be the first app I deploy, so I want it to be sock solid.
