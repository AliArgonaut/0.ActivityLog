# TuneMatch: An AI Powered Song Recommendation Engine 
## inspiration and purpose 
I don't very much like song recommendation algorithms that big platforms like Spotify and Apple Music use. 
For example, I really like Rock Your Body by Justin Timberlake. However, the song recc algos just give me other songs by Justin, which may be by the same artist and may be in the same genre, but I am picky. 
I want music that *sounds* like Rock Your Body. Captures the same funky old school R&B vibe. So, the idea for TuneMatch was born. I will update you with the build process as time goes on, just like with the Todo app.

Today I did a bit of research on which AI I would reference. I don't want to spend very much money, so I think I might use the llama3 api with the spotify API.

self hosting an LLM just isnt gonna work. I have decided to go with Awan LLM for my results generation. Today, I initialized the react app and got a basic frontend up and running. All that is really left is to add the functionality. After I add the functionality I will probably go back in and handle some styling.
