# TuneMatch: An AI Powered Song Recommendation Engine 
## inspiration and purpose 
I don't very much like song recommendation algorithms that big platforms like Spotify and Apple Music use. 
For example, I really like Rock Your Body by Justin Timberlake. However, the song recc algos just give me other songs by Justin, which may be by the same artist and may be in the same genre, but I am picky. 
I want music that *sounds* like Rock Your Body. Captures the same funky old school R&B vibe. So, the idea for TuneMatch was born. I will update you with the build process as time goes on, just like with the Todo app.

Today I did a bit of research on which AI I would reference. I don't want to spend very much money, so I think I might use the llama3 api with the spotify API.

After testing a local Llama3 instance, I have decided running my own LLM would be not optimal, and I think I want to go with the Grok API instead. I gues i'll just load a couple bucks into it and that should set me good for the entire lifespan of the project, unless it gets significant usage, in which case I'll just add a credits system to pay for usage. That's a problem for later. For now, I want to get quick and dirty with the Spotify API. To do this, I will create a spotify clone that uses the API. This would be project 3 in this log. I will return to this project when that project is complete.
