# TuneMatch: An AI Powered Song Recommendation Engine 
## inspiration and purpose 
I don't very much like song recommendation algorithms that big platforms like Spotify and Apple Music use. 
For example, I really like Rock Your Body by Justin Timberlake. However, the song recc algos just give me other songs by Justin, which may be by the same artist and may be in the same genre, but I am picky. 
I want music that *sounds* like Rock Your Body. Captures the same funky old school R&B vibe. So, the idea for TuneMatch was born. I will update you with the build process as time goes on, just like with the Todo app.

Today I did a bit of research on which AI I would reference. I don't want to spend very much money, so I think I might use the llama3 api with the spotify API.

self hosting an LLM just isnt gonna work. I have decided to go with Awan LLM for my results generation. Today, I initialized the react app and got a basic frontend up and running. All that is really left is to add the functionality. After I add the functionality I will probably go back in and handle some styling.

I've been thinking. I got all the way to the LLM Api calls. At the end of this little adventure I will have an app that returns a text list of songs similar to the input song. But I want to go further. I want spotify preview links. This will require the spotify Api in some capacity, but I am not sure how yet. I think I will have to use the <a href='https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search'>Spotify Web Api</a> to perform a search for a track, make it constrained to one result, and return the URL of that track. This will require me to chop up the text reponses into "artist" and "track title" variables, but I think this is all possible. If not, I will have to be fine with the text results or figure something else out. 

Since this is my first big project, I'm going to theorycraft a little to get my plan down on paper in case I write something more formal about this, like on a blog or something. 

I have the skeleton of a frontend done. It has what I need; theres a button, an input field, and a results box. I have a free LLM llama3 Api key from AwanLLM. I have the functions for the results and submit worked out, I have the useState variables and all that, I just need to integrate them inside the components themselves and replace my harcoded results with the results generated by the LLM. 

At this point, I would have a text list of songs. That's not good enough. I want spotify previews, because that would let a user listen to the songs in the app and see if it is in fact a song that is similar. So, the interesting problem we face now is converting the text to the previews. 

Here is how I think I will try to tackle this. If it fails, god help me. Spotify has an API endpoint called Search. It has two important parameters I need, query and type. query should be the artist and the song name. This means I will have to store the LLM generated results in variables for artist and song name, and make calls as I iterate over a list of artist names and song titles. That's just a way to do it off the top of my head. 

That API call will return a big JSON object, but I want a particular key called preview_url. Then, all thats left to do is just paste that URL in to the results box for each of the generated songs, and viola. 

### UPDATE 
fleshing out the props and functions now, pretty close to being at the stage where I can just drop teh LLM call in.
