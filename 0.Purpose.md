[PURPOSE]
My plan is to work on one project every day. I will make one entry for each project, titling it with the name of the project it refers to. I will not move on to another project, and thus another entry, until I complete the first. 

But why publish this activity log on GitHub? 

I have a lot of private repos. I only want my github public page to have completed projects I am proud of, and reflect my current level of skill. And as all developers know, for every completed project there are many half baked projects. 

I am a perfectionist. My public page shows my commmit streak, technologies, and my commit history. But unfortunately, commits in private repos don't show up here, making it look like I literally don't do anything. This agitates me a little bit. 

So, in order to stay consistent, keep my private repos, and keep a clean and professional github public profile, I will be using this directory as a log, so that:

1. My public page reflects the work I am putting into private repos
2. I can be held accountable by making daily logs
3. Others can read a detailed account of each project on my page.

Thanks for coming along for the ride!
