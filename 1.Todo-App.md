# To-do App 

## 5-15-24
I decided I wanted my first published, complete application would be the dreaded To-do app in React. I am following the MDN webdocs for using React, to refresh myself on React. I figure why not make this my first project while I plan some other projects in the meantime.
Today, I initialized the React application, installed my dependencies, and created a simple UI, styling it with tailwind. I have yet to add functionality. I will tackle the start of that tomorrow.

Today I componentized everything, learned how props work, and began to create a useState function for creating a new task Item. I basically started over, so that's why I didn't get so far. I started over because I decided I wanted to create different branches for the different stages of production. I also created a plan for my next (first real) project, with the help of ChatGPT.
