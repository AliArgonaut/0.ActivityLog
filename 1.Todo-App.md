# To-do App 

## 5-15-24
I decided I wanted my first published, complete application would be the dreaded To-do app in React. I am following the MDN webdocs for using React, to refresh myself on React. I figure why not make this my first project while I plan some other projects in the meantime.
Today, I initialized the React application, installed my dependencies, and created a simple UI, styling it with tailwind. I have yet to add functionality. I will tackle the start of that tomorrow.

Today I componentized everything, learned how props work, and began to create a useState function for creating a new task Item. I basically started over, so that's why I didn't get so far. I started over because I decided I wanted to create different branches for the different stages of production. I also created a plan for my next (first real) project, with the help of ChatGPT.

Today I use useState hooks to add functionality. Now, you can add a task to your to do list, but you can't edit or delete them yet. I will probably tackle that tomorrow. I have to look at the code again, because hooks are quite hard to understand. I will become proficient in them in no time, though. More tomorrow.

Added nanoid to track the IDs of new task items.

finished the task counter that displays the amount of tasks remaining,

today I updated the tasks remaining header to reflect the number of tasks currently displayed. I also made it grammatically correct, so one task left would say "task" instead of "tasks".

Today I finished the task completed function, syncing app state with html.

Users can now delete tasks from UI and system memory. Created UI for editing tasks, and now I am finished. Repo should display on public profile now
